# Recipe-Recommendor

## Abstract

Team Achilles collaborated to develop a program in Python that provides recommendations on daily meal and exercise plans based on usersâ€™ weight loss goals. Additionally, the program is designed to generate tailored plans that are adjusted by lifestyle preferences and projected weather conditions. Once a user feeds their basic information, weight loss goals, preferences, and ideal start date into the interface, our program is able to return recommendations that will help the user achieve their ideal weight within the desired time frame. Along with the meal plan recommendation, a shopping list containing ingredients necessary for the recipes is also provided within the program. Furthermore, data visualizations on recipe nutrition distribution and weight loss progression are included to enhance user experience. The project database was constructed with structured [weather data][1] retrieved by API, [recipe and nutritional information][2] obtained from web scraping, and [exercise information][3] retrieved in a CSV format.
